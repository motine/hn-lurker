# HackerNews Lurker

This project is mainly for myself, because I wanted to try out a few things together ([thor](http://whatisthor.com/), [couchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and [celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/)).

```bash
vagrant up # I have vbguest installed
vagrant ssh

cd /vagrant
./lurer.rb help
```
